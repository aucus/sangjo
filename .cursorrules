# Project: sangjo (Vite + Vanilla JS, MPA)
You are working in a Vite-powered **multi-page static site**.

## Non-negotiables
- Work on the **actual runtime entrypoints**:
  - Pages: `/*.html` (root)
  - Styles: `/style.css` (root)
  - Script: `/main.js` (root)
- `src/` currently contains Vite starter leftovers and is **not referenced by the pages**. Do not “fix” behavior only in `src/` unless you also wire it into the HTML.
- Do not edit `node_modules/`.

## Architecture / conventions
- **MPA**: each root `*.html` is a page entry. Keep header/nav/footer consistent across pages.
- **Shared behavior** belongs in `/main.js` (e.g., nav active state, scroll effects, lightweight DOM enhancements).
- **Shared styling** belongs in `/style.css` using existing CSS variables and utility patterns.
- Assets live in `public/` and should be referenced as **absolute paths** (e.g. `/bg-hero.png`).

## Editing guidelines
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible defaults:
  - Images require `alt`
  - Forms should use proper labels
- Keep JS minimal and framework-free (no React/Vue/etc. unless explicitly requested).
- If you need new UI styling, prefer adding classes + updating `/style.css` over large inline `style=""` blocks.
- When changing nav links or layout, update **all pages** (not just `index.html`).

## Vite commands (for docs/tests)
- `npm run dev`: dev server
- `npm run build`: production build
- `npm run preview`: preview production build
